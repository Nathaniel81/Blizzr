## Learning Journey

Building Blizzr has been an incredible learning journey. It allowed me to delve deeper into the world of ecommerce and understand the intricacies of building a full-fledged application. I learned how to integrate various technologies to create a seamless and user-friendly shopping experience.

From setting up the frontend with React and Tailwind, managing state with Redux, to setting up the backend with Django and Django Rest Framework, every step was a new challenge and a new learning opportunity.

Integrating PayPal was particularly interesting as it involved understanding the PayPal API and ensuring secure transactions. Similarly, using Cloudinary for image hosting taught me about cloud storage and its benefits.

Overall, this project has significantly enhanced my web development skills and I'm excited to leverage this knowledge in future projects.
